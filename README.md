# Let Me Read

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./common/letmereadicon.svg"/>
</div>

A Chrome extension that allows you to read those documents which texts are blurred.

For now only works on scribd and studocu, but in the future is supposed to be more expanded for pages that in general blur the content that can be unblurred.
